# Ubuntu VPS Tools

Personal Ubuntu VPS bootstrap and infrastructure tools.

The bootstrap creates a 1 GiB `/swapfile` on ext4/XFS when no swap is active
and at least 4 GiB of disk space is free. Existing swap is preserved.
Use `--noswap` to skip only automatic creation. Unsupported filesystems,
insufficient space and existing inactive `/swapfile` configurations are skipped
with a warning. Creation errors are non-fatal; no swappiness changes are made.
